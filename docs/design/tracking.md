# Implementation Tracking

Living status document for `docs/design/roadmap.md`. Update this whenever a phase's status
changes — this is the thing to read to answer "where are we," not git log archaeology.

**When updating:** change the status/date in the table, add a dated bullet under that
phase's "Notes" with what changed and why, and append a one-line entry to the Session Log
at the bottom. Don't rewrite history in the Session Log — append only.

Status values: `Not Started` · `In Progress` · `Blocked` · `Done`.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap

**Status:** Done (2026-08-07)

Repo layout, `compose.yaml` (offgrid/hybrid profiles, validated with
`docker compose config` — a real daemon was not available to validate `up`), `Makefile`,
`data/*.yaml`/`data/fips.csv` (fips.csv seeded for the Portland WFO area only — see
`data/README.md`), `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`, this roadmap/tracking pair.

## Phase 1 — Channelizer

**Status:** In Progress (2026-08-07)

**Done:**
- `services/sdr_rx`: 48-bin odd-stacked, 2x-oversampled polyphase channelizer, DC blocker,
  FM discriminator, output resampling (22050 Hz / 16000 Hz contracts). Swept-tone amplitude
  test and a dedicated phase-stability test for the `(-1)^k` odd-frame hazard (master
  prompt §3) — see `channelizer.py`'s docstring for how both were derived and verified
  empirically.
- `bench_channelizer.py` / `make bench-channelizer` throughput benchmark (not yet run on
  target Pi hardware — only on the dev sandbox).
- ZMQ PUB publishing (`bus.py`): single PUB socket, `[topic][json header][pcm]` multipart
  frames, `same.<channel>` / `stt.<channel>` topics, generous default HWM per the design
  doc's decoder-vs-live-audio tradeoff. Unit tested over `inproc://`.
- tmpfs 30s rolling ring buffer per channel (`ring_buffer.py`): memmap-backed circular
  buffer of raw (unresampled, `BIN_RATE_HZ`) discriminator output, with a small JSON
  sidecar (`write_pos`/`total_written`) so a reader process (`segment-capture`, milestone
  4) can find pre-roll without racing the writer. Unit tested, including wraparound across
  multiple writes.
- Health signal (`health.py`): per-channel RMS/power, flat-carrier(>30s) dead detection,
  behind a `HealthSink` seam — a `LoggingHealthSink` stands in for the TimescaleDB writer,
  since no service in this repo writes to Postgres yet and standing up that schema isn't a
  Phase-1 dependency. Swapping in a real writer later doesn't touch this module.
- Host-prerequisite assertion (`prerequisites.py`): checks `/proc/modules` for
  `dvb_usb_rtl28xxu` at startup and refuses to start with a clear blacklist/rmmod message
  if it's loaded; a missing `/proc/modules` (non-Linux dev machine) is treated as
  "can't check," not a failure.
- Multi-dongle serial addressing (`capture.py`): `parse_device_config("site:serial,...")`
  parses the `SDR_RX_DEVICES` env var into per-site `DeviceConfig`s (never by index, per
  master prompt §3); `main()` starts one `DevicePipeline` thread per configured device.
- `SoapySDRDevice` (`capture.py`) written against the SoapySDR Python API, lazily imported
  so nothing else in the package needs it installed to be tested. Everything upstream of
  actual device I/O (`DevicePipeline` in `pipeline.py`: DC block → channelize → per-channel
  discriminate → ring-buffer write + ZMQ publish + health sample) is exercised in tests via
  a fake sample source, so the whole path except real hardware I/O is proven without RF.
- `services/sdr_rx` entrypoint (`__init__.py`) now does real work: runs the host check,
  parses `SDR_RX_DEVICES`, and either starts a capture thread per device or reports why it
  can't (no devices configured / SoapySDR bindings missing) and exits cleanly — verified by
  hand for both the no-devices and bad-serial cases.
- `compose.yaml`'s `sdr-rx` service wired with the new env vars and a `tmpfs` mount for the
  ring buffer directory; `docker compose --profile offgrid config` / `--profile hybrid
  config` both resolve cleanly with a daemon available in this sandbox (still not build- or
  `up`-verified — see below).
- `services/sdr_rx/Dockerfile` comment updated to reflect the above; **still not
  build-verified**, and it still doesn't install the SoapySDR system package (see "Not
  started").

**Not started:**
- SoapySDR system package (`soapysdr-module-rtlsdr` + Python bindings) in the Dockerfile —
  left out because it can't be verified without target hardware to test capture against.
- USB device passthrough / udev rules in `compose.yaml` (`--device=/dev/bus/usb`,
  serial-matched udev rule) — same reason.
- Live-hardware verification: all seven WX channels lock on a real dongle, CPU headroom on
  a Pi 5, local transmitter frequency confirmation, host-prerequisite check exercised
  against a real blacklist/rmmod cycle (master prompt §12).

**Blocked on:** RTL-SDR hardware access for everything in "not started" above. Everything
that didn't need hardware for Phase 1 is now implemented and unit tested (69 tests passing
across `services/sdr_rx`).

## Session Log

- **2026-08-07** — Initial bootstrap. Repo was empty (no commits, no branches). Scaffolded
  Phase 0 in full. Implemented and tested the synthetic-signal half of Phase 1
  (`services/sdr_rx` channelizer + supporting DSP modules); the SoapySDR/ZMQ/hardware half
  of Phase 1 remains open. Added this roadmap/tracking pair plus `docs/design/master-prompt.md`
  (moved from `docs/design/master-prompt.md`, content unchanged) at the user's request to keep the
  original spec, phase plan, and live status as separate, purpose-built documents.
- **2026-08-07** — Implemented every remaining Phase 1 item that doesn't require physical
  RTL-SDR hardware: ZMQ PUB publisher (`bus.py`), tmpfs ring buffer (`ring_buffer.py`),
  health signal (`health.py`), host-prerequisite assertion (`prerequisites.py`),
  multi-dongle serial-addressing config parsing (`capture.py`), and the `DevicePipeline`
  that wires DC-block → channelize → per-channel discriminate → ring-buffer write + ZMQ
  publish + health sample, unit tested end to end via a fake sample source
  (`pipeline.py`). `SoapySDRDevice` itself is written but only exercised for its
  clear-failure path (bindings not installed) — real device I/O still needs target
  hardware. Wired the new entrypoint (`__init__.py`) and `compose.yaml`'s `sdr-rx` service
  (env vars, tmpfs mount); `docker compose config` verified for both profiles. 34 new
  tests, 69 total passing in `services/sdr_rx`. Remaining Phase 1 work is entirely
  hardware-blocked: SoapySDR system package + USB passthrough in Docker/compose, and
  live-hardware verification (all seven WX channels, Pi 5 CPU headroom, host blacklist
  cycle).
